#Some say that every one year of a human’s life is equivalent to seven years of a dog’s life. Write a function named dog_years() that has two parameters named name and age.
# Write your dog_years function here:
def dog_years(name,age):
  agedog=age*7
  return name+ "you are " +str(agedog)+" years old in dog years"

# Uncomment these function calls to test your dog_years function:
print(dog_years("Lola", 16))
# should print "Lola, you are 112 years old in dog years"
#print(dog_years("Baby", 0))
# should print "Baby, you are 0 years old in dog years"
